# iHubWebsiteRepo

## Overview
This repository contains components for revamping the Innovation Hub Website at the University of Toronto. 

## Files Structure & How to Use

The three main files that you need to construct the components are:
- components.html: create in text editor, can be used to change the texts.
- components.css: change the styling of components.
- components.js: create animations/motions for the components.

Each component is noted within /* */.
Please copy only the code under the /* */ of the elements you want to retrieve.

## Notes
These codes should only be used for the work at the Innovation Hub.
